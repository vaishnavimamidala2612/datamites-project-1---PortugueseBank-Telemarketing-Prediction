Problem Statement: Briefly explain that the goal of the project is to predict if a client will subscribe to a bank term deposit based on historical marketing campaign data.

Dataset Overview: Mention the "Bank Marketing" dataset, which includes customer demographics (age, job, marital status), financial status (balance, housing, loan), and campaign-related details (duration, contact type).

Data Preprocessing & EDA:

Handling missing values and data cleaning.

Visualizing customer distributions and identifying correlations using libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib.

Encoding categorical variables and performing feature scaling.

Machine Learning Models: List the algorithms you implemented to classify the target variable, such as:

Logistic Regression

Decision Trees / Random Forests

Any other specific models found in your notebook (e.g., SVM or Gradient Boosting).

Performance Metrics: Highlight how you evaluated the models using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and the F1-Score to ensure balanced performance.

Technologies Used: A quick list of the stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Jupyter Notebook.

Key Findings: A one-sentence summary of which features (like 'call duration') were most influential in predicting a subscription.
